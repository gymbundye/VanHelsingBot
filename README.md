# VanHelsingBot
Code-Ky Capstone Project


My Capstone project is "Van Helsing Bot!" It is a database of monster and monster information that a "Monster Hunter" (user) can use to help defeat and track different monsters in the database. Users will be able to view typical monster info like name, age, description, as well as monster weakness and monster location. Users will also be able to see which locations still have monsters and which have been cleansed.

This project will use C# to handle progam logic and sqllite to handle the database models Once I have that foundation set I will attempt to user Blazor pages to render a User Interface to view the data in a more pleasing manner.

Thank you for your time and Thanks to Code KY for the newly aquired knowledge
